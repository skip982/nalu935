A "incomplete" semi-untethered jailbreak for 32-bit devices on iOS 9.3.5 Only ( created by [iosusr](https://twitter.com/shp0ng13) )

Lets make a 32-Bit iOS 9.3.5 Jailbreak for all 32-Bit Devices  

I'm using [935csbypass](https://github.com/kpwn/935csbypass) by [@qwertyoruiopz](https://twitter.com/qwertyoruiopz). 

## Nalu meaning:

Nalu is the Hawaiian word for wave or surging surf, 
and the hapa-Hawaiian saying, to “Nalu it” means “go with the flow.” 
As every person who learns to swim in the ocean knows, 
you don't fight the waves, you ride them.
