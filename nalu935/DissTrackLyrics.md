I used to see these niggas on my twitter feed man,

You niggas well known to start shit,

Pistol on me nigga, ain't no more picking on me.

A thug holiday is where your body lay,

Late came to the realization that your “exploits” were fake, damn..

you nearly broke my heart, I really thought you niggas really owned them exploits.

I used to be friends with you niggas.

Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin, I'm gonna bring my niggas with me if I lose or win.

This little thing of ours is such a head rush until the day the feds rush you, That's when you niggas really wish you put your bread up.

Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick, Rap game so much fuck shit done, That's why this .45 in my boxers.

Shots fired, home invasion, Red beam detonators, whos the bomb now?

Look you in your eyes nigga before I say good night, pray that those exploits get to see the day of light.

Damn, ItzGeb & pythonsn0w, I use to be friends with you niggas, Hate that it came to this.

Shootin' dope, using coke, selling bricks acting like you the real Folks,

Sacrificin' half your life for your new little gay cult,

I pray you find the kindness in your heart, I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame.

Can't believe this shit homie, How the fuck nigga, you touch my code nigga?
And what hurt me the most nigga, Is how you did me like that nigga.

I was loyal to you niggas, You put my nigga @sn0wFX in the hole, homie.

I don't feel you for that my nigga, That shit hurt me, you understand me?

It's painful what you see real niggas do when they get the opportunity.
